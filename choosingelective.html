              <p style="font-size:22px;">
                Yesterday, a difficult task was assigned to me: choosing my elective. And it was hard. Like, 
                <em>really</em> hard. I couldn't decide: On one hand, my dad really wanted me to take one
                elective; on the other hand, I had my heart set on another elective. However, the elective
                seemed kind of dorky, and there was another one that sounded cool. And yet, there was still
                <em>one more</em> elective that interested me: Spanish. It would help me in the future,
                and I could take it for a second language. So, which did I choose?
                <br><br>
                Well, I eventually chose the one that I was really interested in, but what about you?
                Are you in a struggle between picking one elective from the other? Well, use this post
                to choose the elective that's right for you.

              <p style="font-size:21px;">#1: Is it Interesting?</p>

              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                This was the top factor in me choosing my elective. What is your interest? Do you want to take this? The
                whole point of electives is for you to explore new topics that interest <em>you</em>. If you think you
                want to take a specific elective, go ahead! Just make sure you are interested and you'll have a good
                time in the class.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">#2: Is it Beneficial?</p>

              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                Don't choose an elective that probably won't help you in the future. Just don't. Sure, the class "How to Make 
                Good-Tasting Sandwiches" might seem good <em>now</em>, but will it in the future? Not likely. You see,
                if you plan to teach a second language in the future, Spanish or Chinese might be a good choice for you.
                Just because something's easy doesn't mean it's helpful, and vice versa. Choose an elective that you'll keep
                skills from. Explore a variety of skills, so you'll be able to thrive in the future.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">#3: Will it Help You Get Good Grades?</p>

              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                Okay, fine. Maybe this factor isn't the most ethical, but it is still <em>very</em> important. After all,
                if you like an elective, and it's beneficial, <em>and</em> it helps you get good grades, why shouldn't
                you take it? Though some electives, though hard, are still worth taking, many are also good for your 
                grades. After all, if an elective is good for your knowledge, it <em>might</em> as well be good for
                your GPA, too.

              <p style="font-size:21px;">#4: Do your Parents Approve?</p>
              <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6KygOJdEhXICA" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mom-mother-pusheen-6KygOJdEhXICA">via GIPHY</a></p>
              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                Though they are your electives, it's still important to get your parents' approval. You should have
                a long discussion about your future, and who knows? They may just end up changing your mind.
                In the end, your parents are much older and experienced than you. They probably know more
                than you on making important decisions, so it is wise for you to check to see what they think.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:23px;">
                Those were my 4 tips on choosing your electives. I know it can be hard, but electives should
                be a chance for you to grow in your interests. Find a good choice for you and school can be
                great. Just find a hobby that you love, and choose the corresponding elective. Good luck,
                and read on!
