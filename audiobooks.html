                Books. In the twenty-first century, we are finding more and more ways to consume stories and information.
                There are devices now that allow you to read a book with a click of a button. But many people don't
                use a valuable resource: audio. Here is why audiobooks are amazing, with a few titles for you to enjoy.

              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                When you're doing chores, or you're brushing your teeth, do you have time to pull a book out of your local
                library? No! That's where audiobooks come in. Just pop in your earbuds, and enjoy one of your favorite
                stories. Now, you can access your books just by pressing play. Next time you're doing something that's
                boring (besides homework), and you don't want to listen to homework, listen to your favorite audiobook.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">Reason #2 - It's Good for Car Rides</p>

                Ever been bored on a long car ride? Do you get headaches when reading on the car? 
                Well, solve that problem with audiobooks. Just pop in your earbuds, or insert the
                disk into the car, and listen to a good story on the car. Bonus: You probably 
                won't get a headache!
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">Reason #3 - It Can Be More Immersive</p>

              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                Love how movies can make you feel like you are actually there? That is kind of the sensation that you get when
                listening to a good audiobook. Many audiobooks are performed by gifted actors, which can make you feel like
                you are listening to someone tell you a story. Immerse yourself in one of your favorite stories that's
                narrated by a great actor
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:22px;">
                Want to listen but don't know what to listen to? Here are some great titles
                for you to enjoy!

                #1 - The Hunger Games
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                This book is a fast-paced story that will keep you engaged and excited. Enter Katniss's dystopian world,
                where she has to enter the Hunger Games, where 24 tributes are locked in an arena to fight to the death.
                Be warned, this is a bloody and disturbing book, so it's not for the faint of heart. All in all,
                this is a fine book that explores themes such as self-sacrifice and loyalty.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">
                #2 - The Maddie Diaries
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                This book is the memoir of Maddie Zeigler. Maddie can be an inspiration, and it's interesting to hear
                about her life, as she got on TV at a very young age. Plus, it's mostly narrated by the author,
                so it feels like she's telling <em>you</em> the information.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:21px;">
                #3 - Ms. Bixby's Last Day
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:19px;">
                <em>Ms. Bixby's Last Day</em> is heartbreaking and hearwarming at the same time. It follows three
                students who visit a teacher who had to leave school because of her cancer. The book is extremely sad,
                so it may not be suitable for sensitive kids. However, if you love an interesting, inclusive story,
                be sure to listen to this book.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:22px;">Well there you go! I hope you guys go on to listen to some good audiobooks.
              They are a good source of entertainment, so I hope you try some! Read (and listen) on!</p>
