                Books. In the twenty-first century, we are finding more and more ways to consume stories and information.
                There are devices now that allow you to read a book with a click of a button. But many people don't
                use a valuable resource: audio. Here is why audiobooks are amazing, with a few titles for you to enjoy.

                When you're doing chores, or you're brushing your teeth, do you have time to pull a book out of your local
                library? No! That's where audiobooks come in. Just pop in your earbuds, and enjoy one of your favorite
                stories. Now, you can access your books just by pressing play. Next time you're doing something that's
                boring (besides homework), and you don't want to listen to homework, listen to your favorite audiobook.
