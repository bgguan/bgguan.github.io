                During the summer, many of us are tormented by the one thing we are supposed to be free from: boredom.
                Luckily, a good movie marathon is a great cure for this summertime weariness. Say goodbye to sitting around
                and doing nothing with my favorite films for you to watch!

                One of the most well known movies of 2016 was La La Land. Everyone argued about whether
                it was good or not. Some called it cliche, some said it was an amazing movie about everyday life in LA.
                It seems like everyone has an opinion about this film. <br><br>I personally loved it.<br><br> La La Land was 
                a lovely film. The visuals looked like they were all tailor-made for Instagram,
                and the music was absolutely <em>beautiful</em>. Yes, some moments were boring, but it was all saved
                by colorful montages and catchy music. I mean, who wasn't singing "City of Stars" after the movie ended?
