                During the summer, many of us are tormented by the one thing we are supposed to be free from: boredom.
                Luckily, a good movie marathon is a great cure for this summertime weariness. Say goodbye to sitting around
                and doing nothing with my favorite films for you to watch!

                #5 - La La Land
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">
                <em>Rating: PG-13; Personal Age Rating: 10+</em>

              <p style="font-size:17px;">
                One of the most well known movies of 2016 was <em>La La Land</em>. Everyone argued about whether
                it was good or not. Some called it cliche, some said it was an amazing movie about everyday life in LA.
                It seems like everyone has an opinion about this film. <br><br>I loved it.<br><br> <em>La La Land</em> was 
                a lovely film. The visuals looked like they were all tailor-made for Instagram,
                and the music was absolutely <em>beautiful</em>. Yes, some moments were boring, but it was all saved
                by colorful montages and catchy music. I mean, who wasn't singing "City of Stars" after the movie ended?

                #4 - Wonder
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Rating: PG; Personal Age Rating: 8+</em></p>

                <em>Wonder</em>. An amazing book that turned into an amazing movie. When I first read the book, and I found out about
                the movie, I admit, I was skeptical. How were they going to change this moving book into an equally emotional
                movie? Well, for the most part, they succeeded.
                <br><br>
                The movie was extremely well crafted, with some extraordinary acting. Jacob Tremblay, the actor who
                played Auggie, portrayed all the emotions required for the movie very well for his age. Julia Roberts,
                Auggie's mom, was also an great actress. You could tell the whole film was made passionately and that 
                everyone was truly invested in the project. If you're looking for a good, touching film, watch <em>Wonder</em>.

                #3 - The Greatest Showman</p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">
                <em>Rating: PG; Personal Age Rating: 9+</em>
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:17px;">
                <em>The Greatest Showman</em> was a film that got a lot of criticism. If you want proof, you just have to look
                at its 56% Rotten Tomatoes rating. However, just because it wasn't loved by critics doesn't mean that
                it's really bad. The movie is an explosion of interesting visuals and great music.
                <br><br>
                The film is truly fantastic, with the lyric writers from La La Land (Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) doing
                the songs. The performances was great, too, with Hugh Jackman and Zendaya. Though many historical
                innacuracies are present, if you watch the movie just looking for a fun flick, you may just find what
                you are looking for.

                #2 - A Wrinkle in Time
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">
                <em>Rating: PG; Personal Age Rating: 8+</em>
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:17px;">
                I admit, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't completely interested. I mean, the book <em>A Wrinkle
                in Time</em> was one of my favorite books of all time. Madeleine L'Engle was a great writer, and she really
                made the story unique for me. How would they transform an excellent story into a good movie?
                <br><br>
                From its rating on here, you can tell that I loved it.
                <br><br>
                I watched the movie two times in theaters using Moviepass. The movie was visually stunning, with graphics that
                would awe even the most avid CGI-hater. Though it may have changed some parts of the story, <em>A Wrinkle
                in Time</em> managed to, for the most part, keep a core element of the original book, love. After all,
                it is what allows Meg to save Charles Wallace in the end.
                <br><br>
                In the end, <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> isn't perfect. But in end, it showed strong messages
                of self-love and loyalty. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the visuals were beautiful as well.

                #1 - Mean Girls
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">
                <em>Rating: PG-13; Personal Age Rating: 11+</em>
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:17px">
                Now, I know what some of you are thinking: <em>What? "Mean Girls" is for girls. It says it in the name!
                </em> Well, you know what? I don't care, because this film is absolutely <em>hilarious!</em> With memorable 
                quotes and a funny script, <em>Mean Girls</em> is one of my favorite films.
                <br><br>
                One of the messages I got out of this movie is that Tina Fey is an <em>amazing</em> writer. I love her writing
                style, and the quotes that she write are great. ("On Wednesdays we wear pink," anyone?) The acting is superb, too,
                with actors such as Rachel Mccadems and Fey herself.
                <br><br>
                Though it's really funny, one of the great qualities of <em>Mean Girls</em> is its messages. Through the 
                hilarious moments, a message shines through: Be kind. In the end, a message of forgiveness is present, 
                and we learn that we should be nicer to one another. And that, as Gretchen would put it, "is <em>so fetch</em>."
