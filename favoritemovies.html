                During the summer, many of us are tormented by the one thing we are supposed to be free from: boredom.
                Luckily, a good movie marathon is a great cure for this summertime weariness. Say goodbye to sitting around
                and doing nothing with my favorite films for you to watch!

                #5 - La La Land
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">

                One of the most well known movies of 2016 was La La Land. Everyone argued about whether
                it was good or not. Some called it cliche, some said it was an amazing movie about everyday life in LA.
                It seems like everyone has an opinion about this film. <br><br>I loved it.<br><br> La La Land was 
                a lovely film. The visuals looked like they were all tailor-made for Instagram,
                and the music was absolutely <em>beautiful</em>. Yes, some moments were boring, but it was all saved
                by colorful montages and catchy music. I mean, who wasn't singing "City of Stars" after the movie ended?

                #4 - Wonder
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;"><em>Rating: PG; Personal Age Rating: 8+</em></p>
              <p style="font-size:17px;">
                Wonder. An amazing book that turned into an amazing movie. When I first read the books, and I found out about
                the movie, I admit, I was skeptical. How were they going to change this moving book into an equally emotional
                movie? Well, for the most part, they succeeded.
                <br><br>
                The movie was extremely well crafted, with some extraordinary acting. Jacob Tremblay, the actor who
                played Auggie, portrayed all the emotions required for the movie very well for his age. Julia Roberts,
                Auggie's mom, was also an great actress. You could tell the whole film was made passionately and that 
                everyone was truly invested in the project. If you're looking for a good, touching film, watch Wonder.

                #3 - The Greatest Showman</p>
              <p style="font-size:14px;">
                <em>Rating: PG; Personal Age Rating: 9+</em>
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:17px;">
                The Greatest Showman was a film that got a lot of criticism. If you want proof, you just have to look
                at its 56% Rotten Tomatoes rating. However, just because it wasn't loved by critics doesn't mean that
                it's really bad. The movie is an explosion of interesting visuals and great music.
                <br><br>
                The film is truly fantastic, with the lyric writers from La La Land (Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) doing
                the songs. The performances was great, too, with Hugh Jackman and Zendaya. Though many historical
                innacuracies are present, if you watch the movie just looking for a fun flick, you may just find what
                you are looking for.
