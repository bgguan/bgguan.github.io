        Hey guys, it's Brian! <br>I'm excited to be writing a website all about me and my passions.<br> I have a lot of things I'm passionate
        about, from topics such as dogs to things such as reducing global warming. <br> This website is basically just a place for me to
        share my opinions. <br> I will be posting things such as articles about me and music that I like. <br> From learning about my opinions
        to watching my favorite YouTube videos, this website is truly my very own.<br> I am truly excited about this, and 
        I hope you enjoy!
