                Yesterday, a difficult task was assigned to me: choosing my elective. And it was hard. Like, 
                <em>really</em> hard. I couldn't decide: On one hand, my dad really wanted me to take one
                elective; on the other hand, I had my heart set on another elective. However, the elective
                seemed kind of dorky, and there was another one that sounded cool. And yet, there was still
                <em>one more</em> elective that interested me: Spanish. It would help me in the future,
                and I could take it for a second language. SO which did I choose?
                <br><br>
                Well, I eventually chose the one that I was really interested in, but what about you?
                Are you in a struggle between picking one elective from the other? Well, use this post
                to choose the elective that's right for you.

                This was the top factor in me choosing my elective. What is your interest? Do you want to take this? The
                whole point of electives is for you to explore new topics that interest <em>you</em>. If you think you
                want to take a specific elective, go ahead! Just make sure you are interested and you'll have a good
                time in the class.
